Game-Rules
    1. Number cards (2–10): worth their own value.
    2. J, Q, K: each worth 10 points.
    3. A (Ace): counts as 11 or 1, whichever helps you best.
    4. If your total goes over 21 → You lose.
    5. If the dealer goes over 21 → You win.
    6. If both stay under 21 → higher total wins.
    6. Same total = Draw.
